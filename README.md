# Expectest

Expectest is a integration test suite for command-line, graphical, and Web applications.

Its goal is provide a GTest-like output and reporting for integration tests.

## Tools

Expectest provides a unified approach to different testing tools (i.e. it's built on top of other testing tools).

For command-line interface testing, Expectest uses expect. For Web interface, it uses Selenium.
